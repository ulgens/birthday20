## Stay tuned!

Django birthday events are being organized. This website is where it happens and where you can keep your self updated. Have a look at the [events map](#map) and the [events list](#events).

## A special call for proposals! Birthday celebrations!

To mark the event, we are calling for everyone to do a little thing! Meet new people, or gather old familiar friends - down at the pub, in a park, at your school or online. Nothing is too small.

## Support Django

As a birthday gift of sorts, consider whether you or your employer can support the project via donations to our [non-profit Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/) 🫶.

For this special event, we set a special goal! Over the next 20 days, we want to see **200 new donors, supporting Django with $20 or more. With at least 20 of those being recurring donations.** Help us making this happen, via our website or via GitHub Sponsors:

* [Donate on the Django website](https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/)
* [Donate on GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/django)

Once you’ve done it, tag us [on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@django) / [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/djangoproject.com) / [on X](https://x.com/djangoproject) / [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/django-software-foundation/) so we can say thank you!
