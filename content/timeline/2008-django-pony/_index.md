At Cal Henderson's DjangoCon keynote, a joke is made that Django needs a mascot with magical powers. Bryan Veloso very quickly posts [a first design](https://avalonstar.com/blog/2008/the-web-framework-for-ponies/), based on [an image from iStockPhoto](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/fairy-tale-vector-elements-gm91230581-3355498?st=3eb57c4). A tagline "The web framework for ponies with magical powers" is included.

[djangopony.com](https://djangopony.com/) is launched, and a Twitter profile [@djangopony](https://twitter.com/djangopony) adds to the personification. Since then, the initial design by Bryan Veloso has been used largely as-is, meaning that the pony itself remains under copyright to iStockPhoto and illustrator Eric DePrince.
