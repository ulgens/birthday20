Django 1.2 is released, and it's a VERY BIG release.

It adds support for multiple databases, the messages framework, CSRF form protection with `{% csrf_token %}` (available since 1.1.2), the permission framework, email backends, natural keys in fixtures, `BigIntegerField`, spacial databases in `GeoDjango`,

Oh and not least, if you remember writing template tages like `{% ifnotequal a b %}`, those are now replaced by `{% if a!=b %}`.

This is also the first release that drops a supported Python version, as version 2.2 support is removed ðŸ˜µ
