Django 1.3 is released: It introduced class-based views (CBVs) and `django.contrib.static`. Django no vendors unittest2 from Python 2.7 in order to maintain backwards compatibility with older Python versions. The `on_delete` option for foreign key fields is introduced.

The `PROFANITIES_LIST` setting is introduced, rather than maintaining a list of naughty words inside the comments app.
