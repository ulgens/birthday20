[DEP 14: Background workers](https://github.com/django/deps/pull/86) by Jake Howard is merged after a little over 3 months of lively discussions. This immediately turns into a separate [django-tasks](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks/) project, which is targeted for inclusion in future Django versions. Django will have a bundled task handling system!
