    # First Hugo looks in your post front matter for an images value (images: [""])
    # Then Hugo searchs for image page resources with feature, cover or thumbnail in their name. These are images files under a directory that matches the post (e.g. content\posts\first-post)
    # If no images are found, Hugo looks for images (images: [""]) in your site config
    # If no image if found, then an image-less Twitter summary card is used instead of summary_large_image
